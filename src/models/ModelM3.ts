 * The Model M3 was designed and adopted by the German Navy, or Kriegsmarine.
 * In general the navy used a few variations known as M1, M2, and M3. The
 * differences between them is very slight and so the standard of refering to
 * them as "M3" is common place.
 * 
 * A lot of the wheels and reflectors are copies from the Model I, and therefore
 * this model is compatible with messages sent from the Model I.
