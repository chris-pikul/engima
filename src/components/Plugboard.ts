/**
 * The Plugboard, or Steckerbrett is the component that adds additional
 * substitution encoding during the operation of the Enigma machine.
 * 
 * When a key is pressed, the signal is sent through the Plugboard first, in
 * which it may, or may not (depending on how it is configured), re-route keys
 * to a different character. This is determined by the plug wires that are
 * inserted into the plugboard connecting one character to another. This
 * substitution works both ways. For instance, if a plug is inserted connecting
 * A to Z, then on pressing A, the output is Z. Inversly, when pressing Z, the
 * output is A. Most procedures used up to 10 plugs connected.
 * 
 * After the first pass with the plugboard, the new character is sent to the
 * rotor wheel assembly for encoding. After which, the character is passed back
 * through the plugboard for an additional encoding step before finally being
 * output.
